              you sign the contract and pay the deposit, they will increase the
              price for sure, they can‚Äôt find any drivers for $600. If the
              customer still does not agree you can say: Okay, I talked with my
              manager, we can give you a $25/$35/$50 discount only for you, and
              we can do it for $700 in total, including everything full coverage
              of insurance, door-to-door delivery, and deposit as well, what do
              you think?

              keep it increasing if you keep working with so many companies at
              the same time, I cannot work on it as none of the drivers want to
              go for this kind of option! I can work and make the shipment

              price that other companies are offering is too low, and the
              drivers won‚Äôt even call them for this price. You should understand
              it is not up to us, it is up to the drivers. We all work under the
              same system, and the reason why they are giving you this price is
              to get your business. They know they can‚Äôt get a driver, but by
              giving a low price, they can get you and you pay them their
              deposit which is usually $100 or $200 in your situation after
              that, they know you will agree with them even if they raise the
              price. We don‚Äôt have drivers we are middlemen between drivers and
              customers if they say they have a driver that‚Äôs a lie. The only
              hint for you is just to tell them you don‚Äôt pay them a deposit
              unless the driver shows up then you will see either they will
              never disturb you or they will tell you it is going to be
              expensive. Thank you! <br />

              will probably know that guy will increase the price once he find

              <li>
                ! When informing a customer about a price increase on car
                transportation, it is important to be transparent and provide
                clear reasoning for the increase. Here are some steps to follow:
              </li>
              <li>

                customer for their business and explaining that you need to
                discuss a change in the pricing.
              </li>
              <li>
                2.Explain the reason for the price increase: Provide a clear and
                honest explanation for why the price has increased. This could
                be due to a variety of factors such as changes in fuel costs,
                new regulations, or increased demand for the service.

              <li>

                how the increase will affect their overall cost.
              </li>
              <li>
                4.Address any concerns: If the customer has any questions or
                concerns, be sure to address them in a professional and
                respectful manner. If possible, offer solutions or alternatives
                to help alleviate their concerns.

              Hello, Good Day! As I told I have found an exact driver who can
              pick up the car right today. But I should let you know one thing
              the price has been increased by the drivers now I am terribly
              sorry for this case. The main reason for this price increase is
              that there are a few available drivers in this area and increase
              of diesel price. The driver knows that we may get this option to
              ship the car in this case. That‚Äôs why he is asking $300 total for
              this car shipment but this is just an option for now. If you agree
              I will book the driver and the driver will pick up the car right
              04/15/2023 but If you do not agree, I will keep searching for
              other drivers. <br />

              Hello, i have good news for you. Actually, I have found two
              drivers, who are on your road today. The first one said that he
              can not pick up your car today, but he can do that tomorrow for
              sure and deliver it within 4-5 days. This driver said that he get
              the job done for $1075 for total, but then I asked him the real
              price he can go for and he told me it is more then 900 miles
              between these locations, it will not cover his needs if he goes
              for less then $945. Because of current price for diesel they
              usually go for $1,5-2 per mile. So, I was able to get from him
              $130 discount to do this job. Some time later, I found another
              driver and he said that he can pick up your car right today and
              deliver it within 1-2 days. High possibility the next day he said.
              His price was also really high initially, but I knew that is too
              much and started barging and trying to decrease the price as much
              as it possible. The lowest price, which I have got from him is
              $850. But still, I understand that it's higher price then I quoted
              you. anyway I would like to inform you about these options. I have
              to say these are exact and guaranteed options. What do you think,
              Sir? <br />
              As it is your budget I have to ask and confirm everything with
              you. Please do not misunderstand me. I'm not increasing the price
              for myself, but I'm doing my best to keep the driver for you,
              because they said there is only one available spot left, and if
              you agree we can book one of them now, otherwise they they take
              another car and we can lose exact and locked option for now.
              Please let me know if it works for you I can send them your
              address and the driver will pick up your car soon. <br />

              Hello Good Morning, How are you doing today? Yes I have found
              several drivers who are heading to UT and can pick up your
              vehicle. I have negotiated everything like time frame for pickup
              and delivery and price as well. How the drivers are asking really
              high price for this load because of some minor reason of this car.
              But as you know I am doing my best to do everything as we agreed.
              It is a little bit shame on me If I can't get the job done on time
              That's why I am getting the other offers as well Even If it is
              higher than the quoted price. We will quote the customer according
              to the system as well. It was around $1000 when I check the system
              but I am not sure what are the reason for drivers to ask increased
              price. But I am still on the process of negotiating with drivers.
              But If you want, I have one exact driver who can get your car
              right today or tomorrow according to your time frame. this driver
              is asking $2500 to get this load. But I know this is too much to
              afford. But In case, If you order me to book this driver, the
              driver will get your car today or tomorrow for sure. Please let me
              know your decision. I will manage this case according to your
              instructions as well. But Please understand I paid my 100%
              attention to your shipment. Thanks

              Let me explain the whole situation shortly. The initial price that
              I quoted you was based on the last 5 shipments that are made by
              several different companies, but it doesn't mean that every time,
              the price will be constant. I'm getting several available drivers
              on this road with really high ratings. Your car will be in the
              safe hands for sure. I have been hearing drivers' cases for hours.
              They basically keep saying that the price is increasing because of
              the Lack of drivers, fuel price increase, not common road. These
              are the reasons why the price of your shipment has increased. But
              I'm getting more and more calls from available drivers, and one of
              them told me his price, which is 1000$ with top rated reviews, 5
              out of 5. The second one is 980$ he gave me 70$ discount because
              we have worked with him for a long time he is a completely
              trustworthy driver, and he almost never gets any negative reviews.
              Last but the best offer i got so far is 900$, he's also good
              enough to trust him with your car. If any of these offers satisfy
              your needs, please let me know, but they are just options. I can
              keep searching for it. However, the time plays against us. If it's
              not your concern we can have a little more time searching for the
              drivers. Thank you. Have a wonderful day.

              We signed a contract 1 month ago and you are only informing me
              that the driver is asking more on the pick up date.You had 1
              month. Why you did not update me?
            </h3>
            <p class="subtitle">
              Drivers take loads maximum 5 day ahead Cuz they don't know where
              they will go after 5 days not to mention month so there is no
              difference between month and week. On the contrary prise for car
              shipment are increased within this month sir when we gave you
              quote the price was possible to ship but now it was difficult to
              find this driver even for $___(increased price). I also did not
              bothered you because there wasn't any driver who was interested in
              it. I am sure would have hated me if I called you everyday for
              nothing. <br />
              Even if we work on this market on a daily basis, there are many
              circumstances may affect on the pricing like: tolls, weather
              condition, fuel cost, taxes and each state differs from another
              one, I believe you know that more then me. If the fuel in TX is
              low in CA or northern parts of the country will illustrate
              different rates (usually quite higher), which we can not predict.
              It is called road market, where supposed to negotiate and can not
              be stable thanks to variations between state taxes. Drivers change
              their distance constantly. They do not travel back and forth to
              the same area all the time, that's why they have to adapt to
              changes in each aera otherwise they will not meet their needs. It
              is the main reason, why price is always changeable. From our side
              we also keep updated about the situation and try to reduce it as
              much as it possible and prevent cm from over charging.

              What I want to say is that the normal price for this kind of route
              is $700-750, but you are saying that you have better quotes . But
              quote is by its name a quote. It is not contract and can not
              provide you with the exact driver or truck . Everyone can give you
              quotes but only ones are able to get job done successfully not
              upcharging or lying you. I would also offer you $600 or even $500
              just to gain your business , but I see no point from that. I am

              I am a worker of this industry. All of the companies will work
              under the same system. And All of us will use the same system
              price. You are shipping your motorcycle from OH to CA. And it will
              be 2,434 miles. If you want to pay $600, the driver will get $0.24
              per mile. Actually $600 is a very cheap price and even 1-2 drivers
              can come out for this price. If you bid less than $600, it's just
              a scam, because the drive is long and fuel is expensive. It's even
              better if you really want to work with them. But after receiving
              the signed contract from you, they will raise the price. Don't
              always look for the cheapest price, because you can run into
              problems. Even if the price is a little expensive, I suggest you
              choose a quality service.

              Increasing price of the diesel. Hi Sir, this is George your agent
              I am really hard working on this shipment, regardless of the
              difficulties my top priority is your satisfaction. Thank you for
              choosing our service. I can guarantee that your car will be in
              good hands and be taken care of fully insured carrier company. So
              far there were several drivers who were willing to ship your car
              and I have checked everything like background information and
              rating as well. Everything is fine, the rating of the carrier
              company is perfect, the driver is very professional as well. But
              one thing I should let you know that the total price is going to
              be a bit higher than I quoted. Because of the increased fuel
              price. Each state differs from another one, I believe you know
              that more then me. If the fuel in TX is low in CA or northern
              parts of the country will illustrate different rates (usually
              quite higher), which we can not predict. It is fundamental to
              international transport as a whole because the engines of
              heavy-load vehicles like freight trucks, cargo jets and barges run
              on diesel and its chemical siblings and freight trucks, heavy load
              vehicles which need especially for you to pick up your car cannot
              run without diesel. That‚Äôs why the driver is asking high price,
              not only this driver but also other drivers are picking up the car
              for high price. The reason why this driver asking a bit lower
              price is that we have worked with him before so that I can
              guarantee you car will be in good hand. If you want I will book
              the driver now and he can pick up your car right today. If you
              don‚Äôt want I will keep searching.

              from Safe Auto Trucking. So far, I have been searching for drivers
              and I have just found an exact driver, who can pick up your
              vehicle right today.However, there is one thing that I should let
              you know, the price of the shipment has increased by the drivers
              there are some reasons for that. The first reason is that at the
              moment there are too many cars that should be shipped in this
              direction, but there is not enough drivers, so the available
              drivers are asking hight price and taking only highest ones. As
              this driver has worked with me before he agreed take your car for
              $_ price which is very optimal for you in this situation because
              others have to pay even more and he is a very professional and
              honest driver. As it is your budget I have to ask and confirm
              everything with you. Please do not misunderstand me. I'm not
              increasing the price for myself, but I'm doing my best to keep the
              driver for you,and as you know I‚Äôm a worker of this industry and I
              work honestly with my costumers and I always want to make the
              shipment easier and enjoyable for you. If you agree we can book
              one of them now, otherwise they can take another car and we can
              lose exact and locked option for now. Please let me know if it
              works for you I can send them your address and the driver will
              pick up your car soon.

              Hello This is John from SAT, I am working on your car shipment. I
              have great news for you: I found the driver to pick up your
              vehicle. He's a professional and decent driver, whom I trust;
              because I've worked with him recently, and I can assure you that
              there is no better driver than him. However, I have one issue we
              should discuss. As you know in this industry everything, like
              prices, depends on the drivers. So, we, brokers, can't predict
              whether the price will be high or not. The prices might fluctuate,
              one day they will be high, and the next day they will be low. Just
              like in our case, the prices now are ranging from 1000 to 1200
              dollars. And the driver I found required the same price as others,
              but just because I've worked with him before, I was able to ask
              for a discount from him, so the price now is 900 dollars. If you
              want, I can look for other options as well, but I can't guarantee
              you that the price will be lower than that. So, what do you think?

              Hello sir/mam This is your agent, Maria from SAT. I have news for
              you. I have been searching available drivers for the past few day
              on your car shipment but there was not any driver who interested
              in your vehicle shipment. So, today I found two drivers, who are
              on road. The first one is very responsible this job with honor,
              and also has a perfect rating. But this driver is asking just $900
              for total which includes like all fees, the taxes. This driver
              said that he can pick up right today and deliver it within
              3-4days. And also the drive said that the route is very long and
              there are some issues like bridge and tunnels that's to needed to
              bypass. There is another driver on this route but this driver is
              asking $1200-1500for this distance. So that's way he has go with
              empty spots or extra miles. So that th price us increased on this
              route.
